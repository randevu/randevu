Near Term:

* Think about modeling a Table object as well as the Column object
* Think of a DSL to configure what the SQL syntax for a specific implementation looks like?
* Separate out Providers into separate DLLs and load them like plugins?

Future:
* Look into using something like NHibernate to create our schema changes
* Look into directly supporting other kinds of SQL objects
  * Stored Procedures
  * User Defined Functions
  * Would modeling these things as objects help?
